## Hi there ! I'm RAZZ ğŸ‘‹ 

I'm an undergraduate student looking to become a pentester. I still have a lot to learn, but I will share my writeups, notes and projects from the university, hoping it will be useful for someone out there.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the Junior Penetration Tester Path on HTB Academy and TryHackMe.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything about infosec, pentesing, appsec.
- ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡½ I write in Spanish and English. 
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like anime (SnK, Kimetsu no Yaiba, etc.)

**Disclaimer:** I'll be updating my repositories soon ;)
